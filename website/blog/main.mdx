### Playground Improvements

_24 May 2024_

**v0.14.1-13**

- We've improved the workflow for adding outputs to a dataset in the playground. In the past, you had to select the name of the test set each time. Now, the last used test set is selected by default..
  <img

    src="/images/changelog/default-selected-testset_video.gif"
  />
- We have significantly improved the debugging experience when creating applications from code. Now, if an application fails, you can view the logs to understand the reason behind the failure.
- We moved the copy message button in the playground to the output text area.
- We now hide the cost and usage in the playground when they aren't specified
- We've made improvements to error messages in the playground

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the order of the arguments when running a custom code evaluator
- Fixed the timestamp in the Testset view (previous stamps was droppping the trailing 0)
- Fixed the creation of application from code in the self-hosted version when using Windows

---

### Prompt and Configuration Registry

_1 May 2024_

**v0.14.0**

We've introduced a feature that allows you to use Agenta as a prompt registry or management system. In the deployment view, we now provide an endpoint to directly fetch the latest version of your prompt. Here is how it looks like:

```
from agenta import Agenta
agenta = Agenta()
config = agenta.get_config(base_id="xxxxx", environment="production", cache_timeout=200) # Fetches the configuration with caching
```

You can find additional documentation [here](/prompt_management/integrating).

**Improvements**

- Previously, publishing a variant from the playground to an environment was a manual process., from now on we are publishing by default to the production environment.

---

### Miscellaneous Improvements

_28 April 2024_

**v0.13.8**

- The total cost of an evaluation is now displayed in the evaluation table. This allows you to understand how much evaluations are costing you and track your expenses.
  <img

  />

**Bug Fixes**

### Evaluation Speed Increase and Numerous Quality of Life Improvements

_23rd April 2024_

**v0.13.1-5**

- We've improved the speed of evaluations by 3x through the use of asynchronous batching of calls.

### Observability (beta)

_14th April 2024_

**v0.13.0**

You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.

**Running Evaluations**

1. Simultaneous Evaluations: You can now run multiple evaluations for different app variants and evaluators concurrently.

<img src="/images/changelog/eval_1.png" />

2. Rate Limit Parameters: Specify these during evaluations and reattempts to ensure reliable results without exceeding open AI rate limits.

<img src="/images/changelog/eval_2.png" />

3. Reusable Evaluators: Configure evaluators such as similarity match, regex match, or AI critique and use them across multiple evaluations.

<img src="/images/changelog/eval_3.png" />

**Evaluation Reports**

### Adding Cost and Token Usage to the Playground

_12th January 2024_

**v0.7.1**

:::caution
This change requires you to pull the latest version of the agenta platform if you're using the self-serve version.
:::

<img src="/images/changelog/screenshot_cost_and_token_usage.png" />

We've added a feature that allows you to compare the time taken by an LLM app, its cost, and track token usage, all in one place.

----#

### Changes to the SDK

This necessitated modifications to the SDK. Now, the LLM application API returns a JSON instead of a string. The JSON includes the output message, usage details, and cost:

```
{
 "message": string,
 "usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": int,
  "completion_tokens": int,
  "total_tokens": int
 },
 "cost": float
}
```
