## How to Create Multiple App Variants in a Single Project

This guide provides instructions on creating multiple variants within one project. A "variant" is a unique version of your app that may feature a different architecture or significant changes in the codebase. (See [the concept guide](/docs/conceptual/concepts#app-variant) for more details on variants.)

## Ways to Create App Variants

We recommend two primary workflows for creating app variants from the command line interface (CLI):

- [Git Branch Workflow](#git-branch-workflow)
- [Multiple Files Workflow](#multiple-files-workflow)

And one additional method through the web interface:

- [Playground Workflow](#playground-workflow)

## Git Branch Workflow

This approach creates a new Git branch for each variant, enabling version control for each different version of your app.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. For each variant, create a new branch with the command: ```git checkout -b variant_name```
2. Modify the code in your specific file (replace the content in `app.py`)
3. Run the following command with the new code, using the same branch name: ```agenta variant serve```

## Multiple Files Workflow

This method involves creating a separate Python file for each variant in the same folder. It allows easy switching between variants without moving between branches.

To create a variant using this workflow:

1. Copy the original Python file for each variant using the command: ```cp app.py variant_name.py```
2. Run the command ```agenta variant serve --file_name=variant_name.py```
3. When naming your variants, ensure the variant name aligns with the file name (e.g., `variant_name.py` -> `variant_name`)


## Playground Workflow

Alternatively, you can create app variants directly from the Playground interface. To create a new variant, click the '+' symbol on the tabs in Playground.
