## v0.13.0 - Observability (beta)
*14th April 2024*

You can now monitor your application usage in production. We've added a new observability feature (currently in beta), which allows you to:

- Monitor cost, latency, and the number of calls to your applications in real-time.
- View the logs of your LLM calls, including inputs, outputs, and used configurations. You can also add any interesting logs to your test set.
- Trace your more complex LLM applications to understand the logic within and debug it.

As of now, all new applications created will include observability by default. We are working towards a GA version in the next weeks, which will be scalable and better integrated with your applications. We will also be adding tutorials and documentation about it.

## v0.7.1 - Adding Cost and Token Usage to the Playground

*12th January 2024*
<Warning> This change requires you to pull the latest version of the agenta platform if you're using the self-serve version.</Warning>

<img height="600" src="/images/changelog/screenshot_cost_and_token_usage.png" />

We've added a feature that allows you to compare the time taken by an LLM app, its cost, and track token usage, all in one place.

### Changes to the SDK

This necessitated modifications to the SDK. Now, the LLM application API returns a JSON instead of a string. The JSON includes the output message, usage details, and cost:

```
{
 "message": string,
 "usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": int,
  "completion_tokens": int,
  "total_tokens": int
 },
 "cost": float
}
```
