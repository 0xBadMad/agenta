---

In this tutorial, we will walk you through deploying your first LLM app using Agenta.

# Installation

Before you start, make sure you have the Agenta SDK installed. If not, install it with pip:

```bash
pip install agenta
```

# Define your LLM App

The first step is to define your LLM app. You can do this in a standard Python script.

Here's an example:

```python
from agenta import post, TextParam, FloatParam

@post
def generate(startup_name: str, startup_idea: str, prompt: TextParam="Default prompt", temperature: FloatParam=0.5) -> str:
    # Your LLM code here
    ...
```
In this example, `startup_name` and `startup_idea` are required inputs, while `prompt` and `temperature` are optional parameters with default values. The types TextParam and FloatParam are used to indicate these are parameters rather than inputs, and they will be made available for tuning in the Agenta UI.

# Deploy your App

Once you've defined your app, you can deploy it as an API using Agenta's CLI tool.

agenta deploy your_script.py


# Playground for Parameter Tuning

After deployment, your app will be accessible on the Agenta UI. You can interact with your app, experiment with different parameters, and fine-tune your app's behavior to get the results you want.

Regression Testing and Version Evaluation

Agenta provides regression testing tools and allows you to compare different versions of your app. You can use these features to ensure the quality of your application and to decide when to update the live version of your app.

That's it! With Agenta, you can take your LLM app from idea to deployment in no time. Enjoy developing with Agenta!
