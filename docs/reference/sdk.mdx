The agenta SDK allows you to experiment with AI applications with LLMs (and in the future any Foundational Model) in a simple way.

The most commenly used functions are:

- agenta.init - initialize your variant
- agenta.config.default - set the default configuration


## `agenta.init()`

Initialize your variant. 
You need to call this function once at the entry point of your code. 

## `agenta.config`

`config` is an object that contains the parameters for your variant and methods that enable you to pull and push these parameters to the backend. Use the config to save the usual parameters for an LLM variant, such as the prompt, temperature, LLM model, chunk size (for RAG), etc. Everything that you plan to experiment with in the playground should be saved in the config.

The parameters in the configuration are accessible in your code at any module importing agenta in this way:

```python
agenta.config.parameter_name
```

The only requirement is that `agenta.init()` is called before in the entry point module.

## `agenta.config.default(**kwargs)`

Set the default configuration for your variant. For instance if you set 

```python
agenta.config.default(prompt = ag.TextParam("Hello world"))
```

This will set the default value of the prompt to "Hello World". This means that the default configuration (the configuration in the variant variant_name.default) will have the value "Hello World".

agenta.config.default should be used to set the parameters that you are planning to test and iterate on in the playground. For instance if your application has two different prompts in addition to temperature, you might want to use the following:

```python
agenta.config.default(prompt1 = ag.TextParam("my prompt1"),
                      prompt2 = ag.TextParam("my prompt2"),
                      temperature = ag.FloatParam(0.5),
                      temperature2 = ag.FloatParam(0.5))
```

Using this configuration will result in:

1. A playground with the two prompts and temperature sliders
2. An API endpoint /generate wich takes the parameters prompt1, prompt2 and temperature as input

You can later use the last parameters from the configuration (from the backend) the following way:
    
```python
agenta.config.prompt1
```

## `agenta.config.pull(config_name: str = "default", environment_name: str = None)`

This function pulls the configuration from the backend and save them in the config object. The configuration contains all the parameters for the variant. 

The configuration can be pulled by name. For instance
```python
agenta.config.pull("my_config")
```

This would pull the parameters from the backend for the configuration `my_config` (that is for `variant_name.py`, the configuration in the playground for the variant `variant_name.my_config`)

The configuration can also be pulled by the environment name. For instance, you can always use the parameters from the 'production' environment by using:

```python
agenta.config.pull(environment_name = "production")
```

After pulling the configuration, the parameters are accessible in the following way:

```python
agenta.config.parameter_name
```

## `agenta.config.push(self, config_name: str, overwrite=True, **kwargs)``

This function pushes the configuration to the backend. The configuration contains all the parameters for the variant.

The configuration is pushed to config_name for the code base being run. Basically if you are running `variant_name.py`, the configuration will be pushed to `variant_name.config_name`. 

If overwrite is set to True, the configuration will overwrite the existing configuration. If overwrite is set to False, the configuration will be pushed only if the configuration does not exist yet.

## Data types for parameters

There are multiple data types that can be used for the parameters in the configuration. Each data type translates into an element in the playground.

### TextParam

This display a text area widget in the playground. 

```python
agenta.config.default(prompt_system = ag.TextParam("You are an expert in geography."),
                      prompt_user = ag.TextParam("What is the capital of {country}?"))
``` 

### IntParam

This displays a slider widget in the playground with a step 1 (integers). 

```python
agenta.config.default(intval1 = ag.IntParam(default=1, minval=0, maxval=2),
                      intval2 = ag.IntParam(1)
```

### FloatParam

This displays a slider widget in the playground with a step 0.1 (float).


```python
agenta.config.default(temperature = ag.IntParam(default=0.5, minval=0, maxval=2),
                      temperature2 = ag.IntParam(0.5)
```


## Data types for inputs

Inputs in contrast to parameters are given as argument to the function decorated with `@agenta.entrypoint`. They are not part of the configuration but instead are the input in the call to the LLM app.

```python
def my_entrypoint(name:str):
```

Since the agenta sdk uses fastapi under the hood, the data types for the inputs are the same as the ones used in fastapi. In addition, there are some special data types.

### DictInput
This is data type is used to create variants that have a dynamic number of inputs. When used
