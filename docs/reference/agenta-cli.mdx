The Agenta CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool designed to manage LLM app variants used in Agenta.

## Commands

The primary commands provided by the Agenta CLI are `init` and `variant`. 

### 1. `init`

```bash
agenta init
```

The `init` command is used to initialize a new Agenta app in an empty folder. It allows the user to specify the name of the app. It creates either an empty app or an app based on the template. In both cases it creates a config.toml file. In the case of creating an app based on the template it also copies the code for the app (`app.py`) in addition to the `requirements.txt`. 

Note that `agenta init` does not interact with the backend, i.e. the app cannot not be seen in the Agenta web UI until it is added using the `agenta variant add` command.

### 2. `variant`

```bash
agenta variant COMMAND
```

The `variant` command is designed to manage different variants of your application. 

#### `variant` Sub-Commands:

##### `serve`

```bash
agenta variant serve
```

The `serve` command adds a variant to the web UI and serves the API **locally**.

Internally, `serve` sends the code to the local backend, where it is containerized, started and added to the UI.

```bash
agenta variant serve --file_name variant.py
```

Using the optional --file_name argument, you can specify the name of the file that contains the code for the variant. By default, the file name is `app.py`.

##### `deploy`

```bash
agenta variant deploy
```

The `deploy` command adds a variant to the web UI and serves the API **remotely**. The URI of the remote backend is specified in the config file, and can be determined using `agenta init`.

Internally, `serve` sends the code to the remote backend, where it is containerized, started and added to the UI.

```bash
agenta variant deploy --file_name variant.py
```

Using the optional --file_name argument, you can specify the name of the file that contains the code for the variant. By default, the file name is `app.py`.

##### `list`

```bash
agenta variant list
```

The `list` command displays all the variants of your app that are currently available in the backend. 

##### `remove`

```bash
agenta variant remove
```

The `remove` command allows you to delete an existing variant from the platform.
