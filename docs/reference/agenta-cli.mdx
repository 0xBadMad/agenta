The Agenta CLI is a tool used to manage LLM app variants used in Agenta. It allows you to create new apps and deploy variants to the Agenta platform.

## Commands

### 1. `agenta init`

```bash
agenta init
```

The init command initializes a new Agenta app. Users can define the application's name and select the Agenta platform host (either local or cloud).

This command creates a blank application in the backend and generates a config.toml file for configuration settings.

### 2. `agenta variant serve`

```bash
agenta variant serve variant_name.py
```

The `serve` command deploys a new variant to the Agenta platform. It processes the code in the specified folder, with `variant_name.py` as the entrypoint. This command builds a Docker image and deploys a container based on it. As a result, the variant becomes accessible in the web UI, allowing for prediction generation and API calls. The variant is named as `variant_name.default` in the UI.

### 3. `agenta variant list`

```bash
agenta variant list
```

The `list` command displays all the variants of your app that are currently available in the backend. 

### 4. `agenta variant remove`

```bash
agenta variant remove
```

The `remove` command allows you to delete an existing variant from the platform.
