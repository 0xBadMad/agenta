title: Simple App with Cohere
---

This tutorial guides you through writing of your first LLM app using Cohere and Agenta. The goal is to build an app that sorts through a bunch of books and returns the books with the highest popularity. By the end of this tutorial, your app will be set up locally and ready for testing and refinement in the playground.

## Installation

Run `pip install agenta` to install the Agenta SDK.

## 1. Project Initialization

Create an empty project in a new directory.

```bash
mkdir Agenta-app; cd Agenta-app
agenta init
```

Follow the prompts to initialize your project. Make sure to select `start with an empty project` when prompted.

Proceed to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file and list the dependencies:

```
cohere
agenta
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your project is now ready for development.

## 2. Write a Simple LLM App

Create an `app.py` file that will contain the simple script for an LLM application that sorts through a bunch of books and returns the books with the highest popularity: 

```python

import cohere
co = cohere.Client('Cohere-API-Key')

# completion function
def get_completion(books: str):
   completion = co.chat(
       message = "",
       model='command',
       temperature = 0.1   
)
   # Assuming completion is a list with generated text as the first element
   return completion.text if completion else "No text generated"

```

## 3. Add the Agenta SDK

The Agenta SDK transforms your code into an LLM app deployable in Agenta. The resulting code below illustrates how to integrate the SDK:

```python

import cohere
co = cohere.Client('Cohere API Key') # Insert your Cohere API key
import agenta as ag

ag.init()
ag.config.register_default(prompt=ag.TextParam("Your task is to extract only the books with the highest popularity in the list of books in {books}"), temperature= ag.FloatParam(0.1))

# completion function
@ag.entrypoint
def get_completion(books: str):
   completion = co.chat(
       message = ag.config.prompt.format(books=books),
       model= 'command',
       temperature = ag.config.temperature
   )
   # Assuming completion is a list with generated text as the first element
   return completion.text if completion else "No text generated"

```

Let's examine how we modified the original code.

```python
import agenta as ag

ag.init()
ag.config.register_default(prompt=ag.TextParam("Your task is to extract only the books with the highest popularity in the list of books in {books}"), temperature= ag.FloatParam(0.1))

```

- Import the Agenta library 
- Initialize Agenta using `ag.init()`, Note that this call is always needed before using any other agenta function.
- Specifying the default configuration, in this part of the code, Agenta is informed that the configuration for this app is a single app parameter of type text, and the default value from `prompt` is "**Your task is to extract only the books with the highest popularity in the list of books in {books}**" and `temperature` is **0.1**. This tells Agenta how to render the playground for this application with {books} as an input. The LLM app templates in Agenta use the f-string templating language, with prompt variables referenced using a curly bracket syntax. You can add other parameters as you like and these can be prompts (TextParam), numbers (FloatParam, IntParam), or dropdowns (MultipleChoiceParam).


```python

# completion function
@ag.entrypoint
def get_completion(books: str):
   completion = co.chat(
       message = ag.config.prompt.format(books=books),
       model= 'command',
       temperature = ag.config.temperature
   )
   # Assuming completion is a list with generated text as the first element
   return completion.text if completion else "No text generated"
```

- The `@ag.entrypoint` decorator is added to the **main function** of the application, which informs Agenta that this function serves as the entry point to the application.
- In the function block, instead of adding the values for `message` and `temperature`, we are using the default configuration that was set earlier on using `ag.config.register_default()`. This allows you to change the applicationâ€™s configuration from the web interface without modifying the code.


```python
ag.config.temperature
```

All parameters for the app can be accessed using `ag.config.paramname`.  

## 4. API Key Integration

For using Cohere or other APIs, store your keys in a .env file:

```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=xxxxxxx
```

## 5. Run the app in CLI

Use the following command to execute the app via Command Line Interface (CLI):

```bash
python app.py
```

## 6. Deploying to Agenta

Our app is still local. To make it available in the playground, add it to Agenta by running:

```bash
agenta variant serve app.py
```

Now you can interact with the app through the API or experiment in the playground.
For interaction, here is a piece of data you can plug in as input to test the application:

## 7. Iterative Improvement in the Playground

Your app is now accessible in the Agenta UI at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Interact with your app, experiment with different parameters, and fine-tune your app's behavior to achieve desired results.
