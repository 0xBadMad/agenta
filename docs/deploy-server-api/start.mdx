Here's the basic structure and code for `main.py` and `config.py`, along with the scaffolding for routers, services, and models.

`main.py`:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from routers import images, containers

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(images.router, prefix='/images', tags=['Images'])
app.include_router(containers.router, prefix='/containers', tags=['Containers'])
```

`config.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    docker_registry_url: str
    database_url: str

settings = Settings()
```

Create the following directories and files:

`routers/`
- `__init__.py`
- `images.py`
- `containers.py`

`routers/images.py`:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

# Add route handlers for image-related operations
```

`routers/containers.py`:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

# Add route handlers for container-related operations
```

`services/`
- `__init__.py`
- `docker_registry.py`
- `docker_runtime.py`
- `db_manager.py`

`services/docker_registry.py`:
```python
# Add functions to interact with the Docker registry (push, pull, list, delete images)
```

`services/docker_runtime.py`:
```python
# Add functions to manage Docker containers (create, start, stop, list, delete containers)
```

`services/db_manager.py`:
```python
# Add functions to interact with the LiteSQL database (CRUD operations for images and containers)
```

`models/`
- `__init__.py`
- `image.py`
- `container.py`

`models/image.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Image(BaseModel):
    # Define image representation in API

# Add LiteSQL model for image representation in the database
```

`models/container.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Container(BaseModel):
    # Define container representation in API

# Add LiteSQL model for container representation in the database
```

This should provide you with the necessary structure to start implementing the functionality for each component. Remember to import and use the required modules and components from FastAPI, Pydantic, Docker SDK for Python, and LiteSQL.
