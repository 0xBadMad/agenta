title: Applying Schema Migration
description: "Guide for applying schema migration changes to the PostgreSQL database."
---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for applying schema migration to your PostgreSQL database. 

Schema migration is different from [Migration to PostgreSQL](https://docs.agenta.ai/self-host/migration/migration-to-postgres). Schema migration involves modifying the database schema (such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and columns) to match the application's current requirements.

### Steps-by-Steps Guide
1. Execute the backend in bash:
	```bash
	docker exec -it {backend-container-id} bash
	```
2. Apply the migration:
	```bash
	alembic -c alembic.oss.ini upgrade head
	```

### Post Migration

After completing the migration, ensure you check the data integrity in PostgreSQL by accessing Agenta on the web and verifying that your data is intact and everything works fine.

In the event that you encounter issues and need to revert the schema migration, you can revert by running `alembic -c alembic.oss.ini downgrade head` and create a GitHub issue describing the problem you encountered.
