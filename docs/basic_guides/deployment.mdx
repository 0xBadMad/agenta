## Guide for Agenta Application Deployment
draft
Agenta provides a way to deploy an application to multiple environments: development, staging, and production. Each environment has its own unique configuration.

Here's how to deploy an application to an environment:

1. Go to the playground for the variant you wish to deploy.
2. Click on 'Publish'. Ensure the variant is saved before deploying it.
3. Deploy the application.

Your application is now deployed to the selected environment and is available as an API endpoint.

Accessing the API endpoint involves the following steps:

1. Go to the 'API endpoint' section.
2. Select the environment you deployed the application to.
3. Here, you will find the code for the application in multiple languages. This code can be embedded into your application code.

Additionally, you can use the configuration in your application code without using Agenta deployment. This can be achieved by using the Python SDK or the REST API. More information can be found on the page 'Integrating Agenta with Your Application'.
