## AWS
We provide a Terraform module to deploy Agenta on AWS. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/tree/main/self-host/aws).
The terraform module will simply create an instance and the resources needed to run Agenta on it.
You can customize the module according to your needs.

First of all install terraforom and configure your AWS credentials.
Then run these commands:
```terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Once the instance is created, it will install some dependencies and run Agenta on it.
More details are specified in this script: [instance-setup.sh](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/blob/aws-automation/self-host/aws/instance-setup.sh)
