## Why Observability?

Observability is the practice of monitoring and understanding the behavior of your LLM application. With Agenta, you can add a few lines of code to start tracking all inputs, outputs, and metadata of your application.
This allows you to:

- **Debug Effectively**: View exact prompts sent and contexts retrieved. For complex workflows like agents, you can trace the data flow and quickly identify root causes.
- **Bootstrap Test Sets**: Track real-world inputs and outputs and use them to bootstrap test sets in which you can continuously iterate.
- **Find Edge Cases**: Identify latency spikes and cost increases. Understand performance bottlenecks to optimize your app's speed and cost-effectiveness.
- **Track Costs and Latency Over Time**: Monitor how your app's expenses and response times change.
- **Compare App Versions**: Compare the behavior in productions of different versions of your application to see which performs better.

## How Agenta Helps with Observability

Agenta's observability features are built on **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**, an open-source standard for application observability. This provides several advantages:

- **Wide Library Support**: Use many supported libraries right out of the box.
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Send your traces to platforms like New Relic or Datadog without code changes. Switch vendors at will.
- **Proven Reliability**: Use a mature and actively maintained SDK that's trusted in the industry.
- **Ease of Integration**: If you're familiar with OTel, you already know how to instrument your app with Agenta. No new concepts or syntax to learnâ€”Agenta uses familiar OTel concepts like traces and spans.
