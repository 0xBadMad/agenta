Building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) can be challenging. To ensure your app runs smoothly and efficiently, you need visibility into its inner workings. That's where observability comes in.

## Why Observability Matters

Observability lets you monitor all inputs, outputs, and metadata of your application, whether it's in development or production. By instrumenting your app—logging detailed data—you can:

- **Debug Effectively**: See the exact prompts sent and contexts retrieved. When issues arise, especially with multiple calls, you can identify the root cause quickly.
- **Optimize Performance**: Spot where latency spikes or costs increase. Understand performance bottlenecks to make your app faster and more cost-effective.
- **Enhance Test Sets**: Use real-world inputs and outputs to enrich your test cases, making them more robust and reflective of actual user interactions.
- **Track Costs and Latency Over Time**: Monitor how your app's expenses and response times change, helping you plan and budget effectively.
- **Compare App Versions**: Evaluate different versions of your application to see which performs better, aiding in decision-making for updates.

## How Agenta Helps with Observability

Agenta makes it easy to instrument your LLM application. Here's what it offers:

- **Data Capture**: Collect all inputs, outputs, and relevant metadata from your app.
- **Performance Dashboards**: Access dashboards that display key metrics like request counts, average latency, and costs over time.
- **Flexible Environment**: Run your application in your own environment and still send data to Agenta—you don't need to host it within Agenta.

### OpenTelemetry Compatibility

Agenta's observability features are built on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open-source standard for application observability. This provides several advantages:

- **Wide Library Support**: Leverage many supported libraries right out of the box. [See the full list here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/supported-libraries/).
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Send your traces to other platforms like New Relic or Datadog without changing your code. Switch vendors whenever you like.
- **Proven Reliability**: Use a mature and actively maintained SDK that's trusted in the industry.
- **Ease of Integration**: If you're familiar with OTel, you already know how to instrument your app with Agenta.
- **Simplicity**: No new concepts or syntax to learn—Agenta uses familiar OTel concepts like traces and spans.
- **Automatic Instrumentation**: All calls from the Agenta playground are automatically instrumented for you.
