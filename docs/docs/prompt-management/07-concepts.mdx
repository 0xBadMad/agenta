### Templates

**Templates** are the workflows used by LLM-powered applications. Agenta comes with two default templates:

- **Completion Application Template:** For single-prompt applications that generate text completions.
- **Chat Application Template:** For applications that handle conversational interactions.

Agenta also allows you to create custom templates for your workflows using our SDK. Examples include:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Applications
- Chains of Multiple Prompts
- Agents Interacting with External APIs

After creating a template, you can interact with it in the playground, run no-code evaluations, and publish versions all from the webUI.

### Applications

An **application** uses a **template** to solve a specific use case. For instance, an **application** could use the single-prompt **template** for tasks like:

- **Tweet Generation:** Crafting engaging tweets based on input topics.
- **Article Summarization:** Condensing long articles into key points.

### Variants

Within each application, you can create **variants**. **Variants** are different configurations of the application, allowing you to experiment with and compare multiple approaches. For example, for the "tweet generation" application, you might create **variants** that:

- Use different prompt phrasings.
- Adjust model parameters like temperature or maximum tokens.
- Incorporate different styles or tones (e.g., professional vs. casual).

### Versions

Every **variant** is **versioned** and immutable. When you make changes to a **variant**, a new **version** is created. Each **version** has a **commit id** that uniquely identifies it.

### Endpoints

**Endpoints** are the interfaces where your published variants are accessible. You can publish a **version** of a **variant** to an **endpoint**. Each **endpoint** has a user-defined environment name (e.g. development, staging, production) that specifies its context or stage.

You can then integrate the **endpoint** into your codebase to fetch the configuration published on that **endpoint**. Additionally, you can directly call the **endpoint** containing the application running with that configuration.

By default, applications come with three predefined environment names for **endpoints**:

- **Development:** For initial testing and experimentation.
- **Staging:** For pre-production testing and quality assurance.
- **Production:** For live use with real users.

When publishing a **variant** to an **endpoint**, the latest **version** of that **variant** gets published. Each **endpoint** points to a specific **version** of a **variant** (a certain **commit**). Updating the **variant** after publishing does not automatically update the **endpoint**.
