**Description:** This quick start guide provides pointers for contributing to Agenta by working on the SDK, backend, and frontend code. Additionally, it covers how to debug the backend effectively.

## Deploying Agenta locally in Development Mode

Running Agenta in development mode provides you with hot-reloading, so you can make changes to the code and see the effects right away. This is particularly useful when working on the SDK.

### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta.git
cd agenta
```

### 2. Launch the Agenta Server

```bash
./hosting/docker-compose/run.sh --license oss --dev
```

You can start the nextjs web app outside of the container by running

```bash
./hosting/docker-compose/run.sh --license oss --dev --no-web
```

### 3. Verify the Installation

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost](http://localhost). If you see the Agenta web interface, you're good to go.

## Debugging the Backend

The recommended method for debugging the backend is to check the logs from Docker. Here's how:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Select the backend container.
3. Click on the "Logs" button to access the logs.
   **OR**
4. If you are using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps:
   - Go to the Docker tab in VSCode.
   - Select the backend container.
   - Click on the "Logs" button to view the logs.

With these guidelines, you can efficiently contribute to Agenta by making local code changes and effectively debugging the backend. Happy coding!
