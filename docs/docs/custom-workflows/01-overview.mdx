## What are custom workflows?

LLM applications are more than single prompts —they involve orchestrating models, configurations, and processes to ensure consistent results

While traditional tools for prompt engineering focus on optimizing individual prompts, building robust applications requires experimenting with the **entire workflow**, which may include RAG strategies, or AI architectures like agents or chains of prompts.

Agenta's **Custom Workflows** allow you to integrate your entire LLM app code directly into the platform. This enables both technical and non-technical team members to collaborate in the web UI, iterate on its configuration, and evaluate and monitor the application end-to-end.

## What problems do custom workflows solve?

With Agenta's Custom Workflows, you can:

- **Collaborate with Subject Matter Experts**: Empower non-technical stakeholders to experiment with and evaluate different configurations of your workflow.
- **Evaluate end-to-end**: Assess your entire workflow, not just individual prompts, from the web UI.
- **Debug from the Playground**: Use the Playground to inspect results at every step of your workflow.
- **Version control the whole workflow**: Keep track of changes across the entire application, not just single prompts.

You can get started quickly—often in under an hour—using our code templates or by integrating your existing code.

## How custom workflows work

Custom workflows create an endpoint between your code and Agenta, allowing Agenta to modify the configuration in the code and run the workflow.

You can integrate your existing codebase into Agenta with minimal setup:

1. **Define workflow configuration**: Specify the configuration of your workflow that you want to experiment with in the playground and version (like prompts and model settings).
2. **Add entry points**: Use Agenta decorators to expose the entry point functions to Agenta.
3. **Integrate with Agenta**: Link your code using Agenta's CLI with a single command.

After completing these steps, you can:

- **Playground**: Test and tweak your workflow parameters and interact with it.
- **Configuration Management**: Track different configurations and deploy them.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Run evaluations on the entire workflow or specific parts.
- **Observability**: Monitor performance and inspect intermediate steps.

## FAQ

- **How long does it take to set up?**  
  You can usually get started in about an hour by integrating your existing code. Less if you are starting from scratch or a template.

- **Do I need to host my application on Agenta?**  
  No, you can keep your workflow in your own codebase and use Agenta for testing and configuration management.

- **Can I use Agenta with my existing framework / model?**  
  Yes, Agenta works with any framework (langchain, llama index, haystack) and any model. The only current requirement is that the code for the workflow needs to be written in Python.

## Next steps

To start using Custom Workflows:

1. **Try a quick start example**: Follow our guide to create a simple custom workflow.
2. **Explore demo applications**: See examples with real data in the web UI, such as:

   - **Q&A RAG System**: Build a question-answering system connected to your data sources. Use Agenta to fine-tune prompts and configurations in a live playground.
   - **Chatbots with RAG**: Develop intelligent chatbots that provide contextual responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
   - **Data Extraction Chains**: Create chains of prompts to perform complex data extraction tasks.
   - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Design AI assistants for hotels, where one agent handles bookings with function calls and others provide room information.

3. **Integrate your own application**: Follow our guide to bring your custom workflow into Agenta.
