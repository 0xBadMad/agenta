In this guide will show you how to configure evaluators for your LLM application.

### What are evaluators?

Evaluators are functions that assess the output of an LLM application.

Evaluators typically take as input:

- The output of the LLM application
- (Optional) The reference answer (i.e., expected output or ground truth)
- (Optional) The inputs to the LLM application
- Any other relevant data, such as context

Evaluators return either a float or a boolean value.

### Choosing the right evaluator

To create a new evaluator, click on the `Configure Evaluators` button in the `Evaluations` view.

Agenta offers a growing list of pre-built evaluators suitable for most use cases. We also provide options for creating custom evaluators (by writing your own Python function) or using webhooks for evaluation.

The **choice of evaluator depends on your specific use case**. For classification and entity extraction tasks, `Exact Match` or `JSON Diff Match` are adequate. For text generation tasks (including chatbots), where there isn't a single correct answer, methods like `Semantic Similarity` or `LLM-as-a-judge` work best. You can find the list of evaluators and their description below.

### Evaluators Settings

Evaluators have two types of settings:

#### Evaluator Specific Parameters

These settings are unique to each evaluator type. Examples include the `threshold` for `Semantic Similarity Match` or the `regular expression` for `Regex Test`. You'll find detailed information about these parameters on each evaluator's documentation page.

#### Mappings between Evaluator Inputs and the LLM Data

Evaluators need to know which parts of the data contain the output and the reference answer. Most evaluators allow you to configure this mapping, typically by specifying the name of the column in the test set that contains the `reference answer`.

For more sophisticated evaluators, such as `RAG evaluators` (_available only in cloud and enterprise versions_), you need to define more complex mappings (see figure below).

  generation.](/images/evaluation/evaluator_config_mapping.png)

The evaluator has access to the generation data in a JSON format that contains the trace and the test set data. For the above example, the data looks like this:

```json
{
  "testcase": {
    "country": "France",
    "correct_answer": "Paris",
  }
  "trace": {
    "inputs": {
      "inputs": {
        "country": "France"
       }
    },
    "internals": {
      "context": "France,[a] officially the ..."
    }
    "outputs": "The capital of France is Paris"
    }
}
```

Configuring the evaluator is done by mapping the evaluator inputs to the generation data:
