# Deploy on a Remote Server

This guide walks you through deploying Agenta on a remote server, such as a cloud instance or dedicated machine.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A remote server with:
  - Docker installed
  - Docker Compose installed
  - Root access or sudo privileges
  - Open ports for HTTP traffic (default: 80)
- Git installed on the server

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Agenta repository and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenta-ai/agenta
cd agenta
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the environment configuration file at `/hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh` with your server details:

```bash
# Core configuration
AGENTA_RUNTIME_PREFIX=
AGENTA_PORT=80                         # The port Agenta will run on
BARE_DOMAIN_NAME=mydomain.ai           # Domain name without protocol
DOMAIN_NAME=http://mydomain.ai         # Domain name with protocol
WEBSITE_DOMAIN_NAME=http://mydomain.ai # Same as DOMAIN_NAME unless web container is hosted elsewhere
AGENTA_HOST=http://mydomain.ai:80      # API domain name
SERVICE_URL_TEMPLATE=http://mydomain.ai:80/services/{path} # URL template for services
```

You can also customize database connection settings for Redis, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ in the same file if needed.

**Using an IP address instead of a domain name:**
If you're using an IP address rather than a domain name, use the same format:

```bash
DOMAIN_NAME=http://192.168.1.100
BARE_DOMAIN_NAME=192.168.1.100
```

## Step 3: Build and Deploy

Run the following command to build and deploy Agenta:

```bash
docker compose -f hosting/docker-compose/oss/docker-compose.gh.yml --env-file=hosting/docker-compose/oss/.env.oss.gh --profile with-web up -d --build
```

:::info
At the moment, you need to rebuild the web image because the domain name is hardcoded at build time in Next.js. Other services can use the pre-built images from Docker Hub.

## Step 4: Verify Your Deployment

After deployment, verify that Agenta is running correctly:

1. Check container status:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. Access the web interface in your browser:
   ```
   http://mydomain.ai
   ```
   
   Or if using an IP address:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. Check container logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```
   
   To view logs for a specific service:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs [service-name]
   ```

2. Verify environment variables are set correctly in the `.env.oss.gh` file

3. Ensure the server firewall allows traffic on port 80 (or your custom port)

4. Check that all required Docker services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

## Important Notes

- This guide uses HTTP for initial setup. For production environments, you should configure HTTPS.
- For production deployments, set up HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates (documentation for this is planned).
- Resource requirements will vary based on your usage patterns. Monitor system resources after deployment.
