## Templates

Templates are reusable LLM-powered applications that you can start your code with and build upon. 
At the time of writing, there is only one template available `simple_prompt` which is a simple prompt-based application developed in langchain.
In the future we plan to add a multitude of templates for different use cases (e.g. simple chatbot, classification app, chat with your PDB app, etc.) using a multitude of libraries (langchain, llma_index, guardrails, etc.) and LLMs (gpt-4, cohere, huggingface, etc.)

You can use a template when you start your project from CLI:

```bash
agenta init
```
