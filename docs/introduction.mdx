description: 'Welcome Agenta: The open source end-to-end LLMOps platform.'
---

Agenta is an open-source end-to-end platform for productionizing (complex) LLM apps. Agenta enables you to:
1. Quickly experiment with prompts, parameters and complex strategies (in-context learning with embeddings, agents...) 
2. Systematically evaluate your LLM apps
3. Deploy your application in one-click

And all of this without imposing any restrictions on your choice of framework, library, or model.

## Why use agenta?
- You need to **collaborate** with domain experts** and want to get their feedback about your LLM apps and even their help experimenting with prompts and parameters (without having to touch your code).
- Your write your LLM apps using code and don't want to be restricted by library, model or framework. 
- You need to save, version and compare different variants of your LLM apps.
- You need a systematic way to evaluate your LLM apps **programmatically**  and with help of domain experts.
- You prefer to focus on the LLM app and not worry about the deployment and infrastructure.
- You want your data to be private and not be proxied through third-party services.

## What is not agenta?
- A single prompt playground tool. Although you can use agenta for that, it is not the main focus of the platform.
- A no-code LLM app builder. Although we offer app templates you can user from the UI, our focus is on enabling you to build complex apps in code

## Features
- **Parameter Playground:** Define the parameters of your app in your code and experiment with them (together with ) via a user-friendly web platform.

## How Agenta works:
Agenta translates your code into a playground where you and your collaborator can experiment with different parameters and workflows

It also takes care of deploying your app as an API.

It provides with the tools to build you test sets and evaluate your app all in one place.

## How to use Agenta:

2. With two lines of code, specify the parameters for your experiment.
3. Deploy your app using the Agenta CLI.
4. You or your team can iterate, version parameters, test different versions, and run systematic evaluations via a user-friendly web platform.
