# How to File an Issue

Filing an issue is an important step in helping us improve our project. To ensure a smoother debugging process, please follow these steps and provide the requested information when reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Bug

### Bug Report Template

We have a bug report template that you can use to report issues. It includes fields for describing the bug, steps to reproduce it, and additional information.

Create an issue to report a bug by clicking [here](https://github.com/Agenta-AI/agenta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) and fill in the required information to help us better understand the bug. 

## Providing Additional Information

To help us diagnose and resolve the issue quickly, please follow these steps:

1. **Network Logs in the Browser:**
   - Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
   - Navigate to the "Network" tab.
   - Reproduce the issue.
   - Take a screenshot of the network logs or copy and paste any relevant log entries.

2. **Docker Containers Information:**
   - If you're using Docker, open Docker Desktop (if available) or use the command line.
   - Provide a screenshot showing the list of running and stopped containers.
   - For the agenta-backend container, provide logs by running: `docker logs agenta-backend` and include the output, more importantly provide a screenshot of it. 

By providing these details, you help us pinpoint the problem and work towards a resolution more efficiently.
