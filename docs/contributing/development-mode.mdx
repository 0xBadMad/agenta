**Description:** This quick start guide provides pointers for contributing to Agenta by working on the CLI, SDK, backend, and frontend code. Additionally, it covers how to debug the backend effectively.

### Working on CLI or SDK Code

1. Navigate to the `agenta-cli` folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment by running `poetry shell` in your terminal.
3. Now, when you use `agenta` in the terminal, it will utilize your local version from the `agenta-cli` folder.

If running agenta in your terminal still doesn't work after following the above steps, kindly follow these additional steps:

- In the terminal where the poetry virtual environment is activated, run `which agenta`.
- Copy the path where `agenta` is located, and add `export agenta=/replace/path/to/agenta` at the last line in your shell configuration file. If you're running Ubuntu, your shell configuration file will be `~/.bashrc`.
- Go to the terminal where you tried running `agenta`, and apply the changes you've made by running `source ~/.bashrc`. Proceed to run `export` to confirm `agenta` has been exported.
- If you see `agenta` along with its path, proceed to initialize your application by running `$agenta init` and follow through the steps.
- When you're ready to serve your app, run `$agenta variant serve`.

### Working on Backend Code

No special steps are required for working on the backend code. Docker Compose automatically mounts the volume containing the code. Any changes you make will be immediately reflected in the backend.

### Working on Frontend Code

Similar to the backend, Docker Compose mounts the volume containing the frontend code. Consequently, any changes you make will be directly applied to the frontend.

### Debugging Backend

The recommended method for debugging the backend is to check the logs from Docker. Here's how:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Select the backend container.
3. Click on the "Logs" button to access the logs.
   **OR**
4. If you are using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps:
   - Go to the Docker tab in VSCode.
   - Select the backend container.
   - Click on the "Logs" button to view the logs.

With these guidelines, you can efficiently contribute to Agenta by making local code changes and effectively debugging the backend. Happy coding!
