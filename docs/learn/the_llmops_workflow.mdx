## The Difference between AI Applications and Traditional Software

Building AI applications powered with Large Language Models is very different than building traditional software. Traditional software is deterministic, running the command in python `1+1` will always return 2. However if we were to create a prompt asking about the result of `1+1` the result could be anything from `2`, `the answer is two`, `two`, or `I am an Large Language Model and I cannot answer mathematical question`. 

The main issue is that at the moment of designining the software, we have no idea how the LLM would respond to the question. The only way to know is to test the prompt.

As a result, building AI applications is an **iterative process**.
