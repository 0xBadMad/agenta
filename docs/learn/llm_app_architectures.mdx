There are multitude of architectures or pipelines for LLM applications. We discuss here the main ones. 

## The Single Prompt Architecture

This architecture is the simplest. The LLM application is a simple wrapper around one prompt / LLM call. 

In agenta you can [create such LLM apps from the UI](/quickstart/getting-started-ui). You can use your own code in case that your model is not supported (or you would like to add some custom logic for pre-processing or post-processing the inputs).
